# How to Test a Contract
 
Before using your contract code in production, you should always test it carefully, especially because it may cause **real economic losses** if there were bugs or safety issues.
 
There are two different kinds of test recommended for every project using `scrypt-ts`:
 
* **Local Testing**
* **Testnet Testing**
 
## Test a Contract locally
 
The main purpose of local testing for a contract is to make sure its public/entry `@method`s will function as designed. That should be considered from two perspectives:

1. If given the right parameters, a public/entry `@method` call should always be successful.
2. If given any wrong parameters, a public/entry `@method` call should never be successful.

### Use `SmartContact.verify` method
 
The method is dedicated to test a contract call. The function signature is like this:
 
```ts
instance.verify(entryMethodInvoking: (self: SmartContract) => void): VerifyResult
```

Notice that itâ€™s actually a callback function named `entryMethodInvoking` being passed to the call of `instance.verify`. You should call the testing target method in this callback, like:

```ts
instance.verify(() => {
   instance.entryMethod(...args);
} )
```

What it does underground is to transform the public function call to a pair of locking script and unlocking script, then execute the joint script on the Bitcoin Virtual Machine and return the result.
 
### Integrate with testing framework
 
You could use whatever testing framework you like to write unit tests for your contract, take `mocha` for example, the local tests may look like this:
 
```js
describe('Test SmartContract `Demo`', () => {
 before(async () => {
   await Demo.compile();
 })
 
 it('should pass the public method unit test successfully.', async () => {
   let demo = new Demo(1n);
 
   let result = demo.verify(() => demo.unlock(2n));
   expect(result.success, result.error).to.eq(true);
 
   expect(() => {
     demo.unlock(3n);
   }).to.throw(/Execution failed/)
 })
})
```
 
## Test a Contract on testnet
 
After passing local tests, you'd better test your contract on the [testnet](https://test.whatsonchain.com/) of Bitcoin SV. 

The main purpose of testing a contract on testnet is to make sure a contract instance can be successfully integrated with a transaction, and it functions as expected along with the deploy and call transactions.
 
In order to do so, you should meet these requirements:
 
* Get a private key with some amount of BSV tokens on testnet. You could use our [facuet](https://scrypt.io/#faucet) to receive test coins.
 
* Get an accessible Bitcoin SV testnet APIs for querying and sending transactions. You could use our [tool functions](https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/scrypt-ts-example/blob/master/txHelper.ts) in the [example project](https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/scrypt-ts-example), or build your own.
 
Then you could write some tests like this:
 
```ts
describe('Test SmartContract `Demo`', () => {
 
 before(async () => {
   await Demo.compile();
 })
 
 it('should be deployed and called successfully.', async () => {
   const demo = new Demo(1n, 2n);
   const balance = 1000;
 
   // deploy
   const unsignedDeployTx = await buildDeployTx(demo, balance, false);
   const deployTx = await signAndSend(unsignedDeployTx);
   console.log('contract deployed: ', deployTx.id)
 
   //call
   const { tx: unsignedCallTx } = buildCallTxAndNextInstance(
     deployTx, demo,
     (demoInst: Demo) => {
       demoInst.add(3n);
     }
   );
 
   const callTx = await signAndSend(unsignedCallTx);
   console.log('contract called: ', callTx.id)
 })
})
```
